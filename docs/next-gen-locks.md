# Next-Gen Smart Locks (2025-2026)

The cutting-edge locks that leapfrog legacy hotel lock systems.

## Aqara Smart Lock U400

**Price: $269.99** | Launched at CES 2026

The most advanced consumer lock available. UWB (Ultra-Wideband) hands-free unlocking — the door unlocks automatically as you walk up to it. No tapping, no fingerprint, no PIN. Your iPhone/Apple Watch in your pocket is enough.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| UWB Auto-Unlock | Detects your precise position & trajectory — only unlocks when approaching from outside |
| Matter over Thread | Works with Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa, SmartThings, Home Assistant — no proprietary hub |
| Aliro-ready | Future cross-platform standard (Samsung Wallet support Q1 2026) |
| Apple Home Key | Works even when phone battery is dead |
| Multi-access | Fingerprint, NFC, PIN, physical key, voice, app |
| Rechargeable | USB-C, 6-month battery life |
| IP65 | Weather resistant |

**Why it matters:** UWB uses time-of-flight positioning (like AirTags) instead of Bluetooth signal strength, making it virtually impossible to relay-attack.

## Goki SmartLock PRO

**#1 Rated Hotel Tech 2026** | Red Dot Design Award winner

Purpose-built for hospitality. Skip the legacy SALTO/Dormakaba nonsense.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| App Store | First lock with an App Store — plug in any PMS, check-in app, or guest communication platform |
| Self-install | No expensive locksmith required |
| SmartDisc retrofit | Upgrades existing electronic locks without replacement |
| Multiple access | BLE, NFC, DoorCode, keycard, physical key |
| Connectivity | Wi-Fi + BLE — real-time cloud sync |
| Power | Rechargeable Li-ion — no disposable batteries |

## Native Apple/Google Wallet Keys

**No App Required** | TIME's Best Inventions 2025 (Alliants solution)

Guests can:
- Get room key via email confirmation
- Add directly to Apple/Google Wallet
- Tap phone or watch to unlock — no app download
- Key works for 5 hours after phone battery dies

**Note:** Works with existing VingCard, SALTO, Dormakaba hardware but requires Vostio or similar middleware.

## The Future: Matter + Thread + Aliro

The real leapfrog is the open standard stack:

| Technology | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Matter | Universal smart home protocol — one lock works with Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung |
| Thread | Low-power mesh networking — no WiFi dependency, better range |
| Aliro | Cross-platform mobile credential standard (coming 2026) — any phone unlocks any lock |

**Locks built on this stack:** Aqara U400, Kwikset Aura Reach, Schlage Sense Pro

## Bottom Line

If you're building something new and want to skip the legacy lock vendor lock-in:

| Use Case | Recommendation | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Residential / Small Hospitality | **Aqara U400** ($270) | Best tech, Matter-native |
| Hotels | **Goki** | Purpose-built, modern API, self-install |
| Existing Hotel Locks | **FLEXIPASS + Wallet Keys** | Adds Apple/Google Wallet to your current hardware |

The old guard (SALTO, Dormakaba, ASSA ABLOY) are playing catch-up with Wallet integration, but their core systems are still:
- Proprietary
- Quote-only pricing
- Require installers

The new players are:
- API-first
- Self-install
- Standard-based
