## Regional Considerations

### Penang

- Mix of condos and landed
- Similar to KL for condos
- Older shophouses may have different locks

### Johor Bahru

- Close to Singapore
- Similar standards to SG
- New developments use euro cylinders

### East Malaysia (Sabah, Sarawak)

- Less standardized
- More landed property
- Assess on case-by-case basis

---

## Installation Considerations

### Condo/Apartment

- **JMB/MC approval**: Check with Joint Management Body
- **Fire door**: Main doors usually fire-rated, Nuki doesn't affect this
- **Common corridor**: Ensure Nuki doesn't protrude excessively

### Landed Property

- **Gate vs door**: Nuki is for doors, not gates
- **Multiple entry points**: May need multiple units
- **Grille doors**: Common in MY - Nuki goes on main door, not grille
