## Lock Types Comparison

### What's the Difference?

| Lock Type | Image | Where Used | Nuki Compatible? |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------------|
| **US Deadbolt** | ![Nuki US](nuki-us-smart-lock.png) | USA, Canada | ✅ Smart Lock (US) |
| **Euro Cylinder** | ![Cylinder Types](cylinder-types.webp) | Europe, SEA | ✅ Smart Lock Pro |
| **Lockwood 001 Rim Lock** | ![Lockwood](lockwood-001-rimlock.jpg) | Australia | ❌ NOT COMPATIBLE |

### The Australian Problem: Lockwood 001

![Lockwood 001 Rim Lock](lockwood-001-rimlock.jpg)

**This is NOT a cylinder** - it's a surface-mounted rim lock. Nuki cannot attach to this.
- Most common residential lock in Australia (~60%)
- Surface-mounted on inside of door
- Has a snib (small twist), not a thumbturn
- **Solution**: Replace with euro cylinder mortise lock, OR use alternative smart lock
